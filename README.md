# Fiddle-Tour-Fraudulent-Taxi-Trip-Detection-using-KNN-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
To enhance the accuracy of detecting fraudulent taxi trips in unmetered trajectories, the system currently employs a map-matching algorithm with suboptimal results. In response, we propose the integration of the KNN algorithm to significantly improve accuracy in identifying fraudulent trips
